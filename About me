Hi, my name is Svetlana, I'm 22 years old and now I work as an event supervisor, mainly in MICE tourism. The organization of seminars and exhibitions (MICE) plays a major part in measuring and promoting sustainable tourism. 
Smart organisations and tourism business executives produce state-of-the-art events and MICE tourism programmes to create a steady stream of tourists and support local institutions. Infrastructure is a key requirement in the preparation procedure for MICE events.
